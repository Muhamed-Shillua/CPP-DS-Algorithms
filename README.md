# C++ Data Structures & Algorithms Repository

Welcome to this **professional C++ Data Structures & Algorithms repository**. This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of clean, modular, and well-documented implementations of fundamental data structures commonly studied in standard online courses and university curricula.

## Contents

The repository includes implementations of the following core data structures:

* **Stack**
* **Queue**
* **Linked List**

  * Singly Linked List
  * Doubly Linked List
  * Circular Linked List
* **Trees**

  * Binary Tree
  * Binary Search Tree (BST)
* **Heap**

  * Min Heap
  * Max Heap
* **Hash Table**
* **Graph Representations**

  * Adjacency Matrix
  * Adjacency List
* **Trie (Prefix Tree)**

## Features

* **Clean and modular code**: Each data structure has its own folder with separate header and source files.
* **Consistent naming conventions** and modern C++ best practices.
* **Ready for expansion**: New data structures or algorithm implementations can be easily added.
* **Professional documentation style**: Clear comments and structure for maintainability and readability.

## Purpose

This repository is designed to serve as a **professional reference and practice tool** for anyone learning or teaching C++ data structures and algorithms. It demonstrates disciplined coding practices and provides a foundation for building more complex systems.
